<p>If using a dataset that is not aligned with the MSF data dictionary, the variable names and values must be standardised. This is because later parts of the template expect certain variable names and values.</p>
<p><strong>This process can take some time</strong> and requires looking back-and-forth between your dataset, RStudio, and the MSF data dictionary. In this example, here are the steps taken:</p>
<div id="review-the-msf-data-dictionary" class="section level3">
<h3>Review the MSF data dictionary</h3>
<p>Uncomment and run this command, found in the <code>prep_nonDHIS_data</code> chunk, to view the MSF data dictionary for the disease (“AJS” in this example).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creates object linelist_dict using the msf_dict function from the sitrep package
linelist_dict &lt;- msf_dict(&quot;AJS&quot;, compact = FALSE) %&gt;%
  select(option_code, option_name, everything())</code></pre>
<p>The dataframe <code>linelist_dict</code> should appear in your Environment pane. You can view the data dictionary by running the command <code>View(linelist_dict)</code> (note capital V), or by clicking on <code>linelist_dict</code> in the Environment pane.</p>

</div>
<div id="clean-the-variable-names" class="section level3">
<h3>Clean the variable names</h3>
<p>These steps standardize how your variable names are written, such as changing spaces and dots to underscores (&quot;_&quot;). <strong>Uncomment these lines of code in the <code>prep_nonDHIS_data</code> chunk</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>First, make a copy of the dataframe <code>linelist_raw</code> but with a new name: <code>linelist_cleaned</code>.</strong> Throughout the template you will modify and improve this <code>linelist_cleaned</code> dataframe. However, you can always return to the <code>linelist_raw</code> version for reference.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>## make a copy of your orginal dataset and name it linelist_cleaned
linelist_cleaned &lt;- linelist_raw</code></pre>
<p><strong>Second, use the <code>clean_labels()</code> function</strong> from the <strong>epitrix</strong> package to fix any variable names with non-standard syntax. These code lines take the column names, clean them, and then store the cleaned names in the vector <code>cleaned_colnames</code>. The second code line over-writes the old column names of <code>linelist_cleaned</code> with the improved ones.</p>
<p>{{% notice tip %}}
If you have a variable named “#” it may be removed by the <code>clean_labels()</code> function. You can protect it by adding the argument <code>protect = &quot;#&quot;</code>.
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Store cleaned column names
cleaned_colnames &lt;- epitrix::clean_labels(colnames(linelist_raw))

# Overwrite variable column names with clean ones
colnames(linelist_cleaned) &lt;- cleaned_colnames</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="match-variables-to-align-with-data-dictionary" class="section level3">
<h3>Match variables to align with data dictionary</h3>
<p>Standardized variable names are required for this template to work smoothly, and the variable names in our Am Timan dataset do not align with the names this template expects.</p>
<p><strong>We need to change many variable names, and R4Epis developed a special function to help map variables to the expected variable names.</strong> The template also offers code that you can uncomment if there are only a few variable names to change.</p>
<div id="paste-the-disease-specific-rename-helper-into-the-script" class="section level4">
<h4>Paste the disease-specific rename helper into the script</h4>
<p>This is done by uncommenting and running a command found in the <code>match_column_names</code> section—near the end of the chunk <code>prep_nonDHIS_data</code>. We run the command <code>msf_dict_rename_helper()</code> with “AJS” to get the correct helper for this case study.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>msf_dict_rename_helper(&quot;AJS&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Running this command copies a block of code text to our clipboard. Now, <em>paste</em> from your clipboard into the template in the bottom of the code chunk. For the AJS template, the code that is pasted will look like the code below. This code uses the function <code>rename()</code> to change variable names.</p>
<p>{{% notice tip %}}
Be sure to paste the AJS rename helper code into an existing R code chunk (e.g. the bottom of <code>prep_nonDHIS_data</code>), not into the white space of the RMarkdown script.

</div>
<div id="complete-the-mapping-of-variable-names" class="section level4">
<h4>Complete the mapping of variable names</h4>
<p>The variables will be in alphabetical order, sorted by if the appear in the template (REQUIRED) or not (optional).</p>
<p>{{% notice tip %}}
Some variables—such as lab results or symptoms—are listed as REQUIRED, but are not absolutely necessary for the template to run. If you do not have a variable and are unsure if it’s necessary, do a search in the template to see if it’s marked as OPTIONAL in the code chunk.
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>To the right of each equals sign, and before each comma, type the <em>exact</em> names of the variables from your dataset that correspond to the expected MSF data dictionary variables on the left. The last un-commented line should not have a comma at the end.</p>
<p>{{% notice info %}}
Be sure to comment (#, ctrl + shift + c) out the lines of each data dictionary variable in the helper that is not present in your dataset!
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<p><img src="/images/AJS_Variable_Names.gif" /></p>
<p>{{% notice tip %}}
If you see this error:<br />
<code>Error in is_symbol(expr) : argument &quot;expr&quot; is missing, with no default</code><br />
then you likely forgot to comment (#) the line for a variable you did not use.
{{% /notice %}}</p>
<p>And now you can see the result:</p>
